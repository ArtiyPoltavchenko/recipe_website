### Instructions
1. Make the dough for the dumplings. To do this, first sift the flour.
2. Boil the kettle. Pour salt into a bowl. Add 1 cup of boiling water.
3. Sift in the sifted flour and quickly knead into a soft dough.
4. Place the dumpling dough on a floured board, knead well so that the dough does not stick to your hands. Cover the dough with a towel. Let stand for 20 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, make the filling for the dumplings. Peel onions, wash and chop finely.
6. Wash meat, cut into pieces. Put through a meat grinder. Season with salt and pepper. Add onions.

8. Divide the dumpling dough into 4 pieces. Roll each piece into a sausage.
9. Cut each sausage into 15-16 pieces. Roll each piece with a rolling pin into a circle.
10. Place a teaspoonful of minced meat on each dough circle. Fold the piece in half and carefully pinch the edges together, pinch the ears together.
11. Do this for all the dumplings. Cover with a towel so they don't dry out. Or freeze for later use.
12. Boil 2.5 liters of water. Salt. Put in one portion of dumplings. Stir to prevent sticking. Allow to boil until the dumplings float and reduce the heat to medium. Cook the homemade dumplings until tender, 4-5 minutes.
